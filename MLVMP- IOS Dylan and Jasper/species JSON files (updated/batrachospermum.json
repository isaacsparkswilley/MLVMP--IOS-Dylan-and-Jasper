		"Classification":
		[
			"Chlorophyta"
		],

		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	"Branching filaments arranged loosely around a center, forming a somewhat spherical branching mass",
			"May grow to be the size of a tennis-ball or larger",
			"Pink, purple, blue-green, green, brown, or yellow in color",
			"Under magnification, the tear-drop shaped cells, forming long, branched, threadlike filaments may be seen (like little glass beads strung on a thread)",
			"The delicate strands feel slimy, gelatinous, to the touch."
		],

		"Biology":
		[	"Propagation through sexual reproduction; the male cells (antheridia) do not swim, meeting the female cells (carpogonium) simply by chance as they drift upon the current; after fertilization, spores are formed in clusters around the base of the carpogonium.",
			"Has a wide environmental tolerance with respect to light, current velocity, pH and temperature"


		],

		"Habitat":
		[	"Lakes, ponds, wetlands, pools in sphagnum bogs",
			"Common in slow-flowing streams, especially shady sites"
