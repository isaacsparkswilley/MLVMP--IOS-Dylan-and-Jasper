		"Details":
		[	
			"Turbidity is generally caused by tiny particles suspended in water that scatter light and obscure visibility, similar to the way the ash particles in smoke obscure visibility in the air.",
			"Particulate matter that causes turbidity can include sediment (especially clay and silt), fine organic and inorganic matter, soluble colored organic compounds, algae, and other microscopic organisms.",
			"An increase in turbidity may be associated with declining lake water quality."
