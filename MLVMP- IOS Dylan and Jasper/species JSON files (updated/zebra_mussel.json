		],
		
		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	
			"Typically a pattern of dark and light stripes on outer shell",
			"Outer shell can sometimes be one color (either dark or light) with no very little striping",      
			"Shells are D-shaped",     
			"Attach strongly to substrates with byssal threads", 
			"Stable on flattened underside (quagga mussels are lacking a flat underside and will fall over)",
			"Size: Adults can range from the size of a fingernail to around 50mm long—are much smaller than quagga mussels"
		],

		"Biology":
		[	
			"Life is usually about 4-5 years long",     
			"Female mussels begin reproducing within 6-7 weeks of settling",
			"Adult female zebra mussels can produce 30,000 to 40,000 eggs in each reproductive cycle—over 1 million each year",
			"Veligers drift in the water for several weeks and then settle onto any hard surface they can find",
			"Mussels can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and adults can even survive out of water for about 7 days"
		],

		"Diet":
		[
			"Remove suspended particulates from the water column through filter feeding"

		],

		"Habitat":
		[	
			"Attach to any stable substrate in the water column or benthos: rock, macrophytes, artificial surfaces, crayfish, other clams, and each other, forming dense colonies",   
			 "In areas where hard substrates are lacking, such as a mud or sand, zebra mussels cluster on any hard surface available",    
			 "Mussels have acclimated to temperatures ranging from 3 degrees Celsius to 35 degrees Celsius—with the optimal temperature for releasing eggs to be about 17 degrees Celsius",      
			"Outcompete native species and can completely drive them out"
