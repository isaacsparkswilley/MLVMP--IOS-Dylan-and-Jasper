		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	
			"Gray or tan frog marked with seven to twenty-one irregular rectangular dark brown spots that are oriented in two columns down its back",
			"Distinctive rectangular spots of the pickerel frog may blend together to form a long rectangle along the back",  
			"Prominent dorsolateral ridges that are unbroken",
			"Orange or yellow flash pattern found on the inner surface of the hind legs (frog must be picked up to examine this—legs cover the coloration)", 
			"No webbed toes",
			"Size: Adults can be between 4-8cm long"
		],

		"Biology":
		[	
			"Breeding season lasts from March to May (usually beginning as Leopard Frogs are concluding their breeding activity)",
			"Males find mates by calling out a low-pitched snore",
			"Egg masses of 2000-3000 eggs are typically laid in well-vegetated areas and are often difficult to locate (masses superficially resemble those of wood frogs)",  
			"Eggs are multicolored—dark brown on top and cream colored on the bottom",
			"Egg masses adhere to woody or herbaceous vegetation, varying in depth from a few centimeters below the surface to 4 feet deep",
			"Eggs usually hatch in 11–21 days—temperature dependent",
			"Tadpole stage lasts about 3 months until they metamorphose into frogs (initially still have tails when they emerge from the water)",
			"Females are typically larger and darker than males"

		],

		"Habitat":
		[	
			"Along the edges of streams, lakes, rivers, and flooded ditches",
			"Grassy areas close to water",
			"Northern Species: Live near cold, clear water",
			"Prefer rocky ravines, bogs and meadow streams",
			"Can be found around lakes and rivers that are heavily wooded",  
			"Southern Species: Prefers warmer waters—like those of the Coastal Plain and floodplain swamps"
		],
		"Diet":
		[
			"Insects, spiders, sawfly larvae and other invertebrates"
