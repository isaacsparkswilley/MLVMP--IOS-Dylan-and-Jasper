		"Details":
		[	
			"Most foam on lakes is natural and does not indicate pollution.",
			"Organic material from decomposing plants and animals acts as a surfactant to reduce the surface tension of the water (in the same way that detergent reduces surface tension).  When low-surface-tension water mixes with air - through wave and wake action for example - bubbles are formed.",
			"These natural lake bubbles are easily blown by the wind into quieter waters where they may accumulate as clumps of foam.  The foam may be white, off-white, or brownish.",
			"Unlike foam from detergent, natural foam often smells fishy or earthy (not perfumed), and breaks apart easily when disturbed."
