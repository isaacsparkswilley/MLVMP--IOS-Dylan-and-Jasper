		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	"Forms dense light-green mat comprised of filaments that are joined hexagonally, resembling a net",
			"The net-like appearance is more clearly visible when the water is squeezed out of the mat.",
			"Under the microscope the net arrangement of the cells is the most obvious feature that distinguishes Hydrocictyon from other algae."
		],

		"Biology":
		[	"Reproduction is asexual, by vegetative cell division",
			"Requires high alkalinity",
			"Indicator of very high nitrogen and phosphorus levels"

		"Habitat":

			"Farm ponds"
			
		],

		"Commonly Seen":
		[	
			"Shallow areas"

		"Range":
