	{	
		"Classification":
		[
			"Charophyta"
		],

		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	"Macro algae resembling higher plants",
			"Chains of single tube shaped cells form tentacle-like branches arranged in whorls",
			"Plant-like colonies 1cm to 1m",
			"Dark green to bright green in color; translucent; smooth to touch",
			"Can form dense mats on the lake bottom"
			
		
		],

		"Biology":
		[	"Colonies reproduce vegetatively through rhizoids and fragments, and sexually with male reproductive structures (antheridium) and female structures (oogonium).",
			"Stoneworts anchor themselves to the bottom with colorless hair-like filaments called rhizoids. Rhizoids act as roots, absorbing nutrients and providing stability. Stoneworts also have the ability to absorb nutrients through all surfaces, not just the rhizoids.",
			"Rhizoids and stem fragments overwinter in and on the sediment; growth begins when the water warms in the spring and continues through late fall",
			"Colonies provide cover and food for fish and invertebrates; algae and invertebrates that collect on the thick growth are attractive to waterfowl"
		],

		"Habitat":
		[	"Grows in freshwater to slightly brackish water to depths of 10 meters",
			"Prefers soft sediments; can tolerate low nutrient and light levels",
			"Lakes, ponds, rivers, periodic waters"
		],

		"Look Alikes":
		[
			"European Naiad",
			"Fine-leaved Pondweeds",
			"Hornworts",
			"Muskgrass",
			"Native naiads",
			"Starry Stonewort"
				
		],

		"Commonly Seen":
		[	
			"Midwater - Shallow",
			"Midwater - Deep",
			"Lake bottom"
		],

		"Range":
		[	"Worldwide, approximately 30 species in US"
