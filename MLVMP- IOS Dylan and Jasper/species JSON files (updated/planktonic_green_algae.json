		"Classification":
		[
			"Chlorophyta"

		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	"Grass-green colored water looks murky (like green paint); individual algae are rarely visible",
			"Color is caused by proliferation of microscopic free-floating (planktonic) plants, suspended in the top few feet of water of a pond or lake where light is bright enough for algae to produce food by photosynthesis",
			
			"Under a microscope green algae takes many forms.  Some species are egg-shaped, some filamentous; others resemble barrels, snowflakes, bugs and more!"
		],

		"Biology":
		[	"Reproduction is asexual, by vegetative cell division",
			"Life cycles may include both single cell stage (some propelled by flagella) and multicellular stages consisting of cells being joined into thread-like filaments or geometric shapes",
			"Numerous green algae species are naturally occurring in most Maine lakes, and are vital components of lake ecosystems"
		],

		"Habitat":
		[	"Lakes; ponds; wetlands",
			"Low water flow areas"
		],

		"Commonly Seen":
		[	
			"Midwater - Shallow"
			
		],

		"Range":
		[	"Worldwide"
