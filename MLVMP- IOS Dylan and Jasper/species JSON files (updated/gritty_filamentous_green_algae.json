		"Classification":

			"Chlorophyta"

		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	"Algal mat feels coarse or gritty to the touch",
			"Mat may begin forming on bottom of lake, and then rise to surface.  May be observed as a dense dark mat on the bottom, suspended \"clouds\" in the water column, or a bubbling greenish mass floating on the water surface",
			"Dense mats can impede activities like swimming and fishing, and may cause odor problems and oxygen depletion"
		
		],

		"Biology":
		[	"Reproduction is asexual, by vegetative cell division",
			"Life cycles may include both single cell stage (some propelled by flagella) and multicellular stages consisting of cells being joined end-to-end forming thread-like filaments",
			"Numerous green algae species are naturally occurring in most Maine lakes, and are vital components of lake ecosystems."

		"Habitat":
		[	"Freshwater lakes, ponds, wetlands"

		"Commonly Seen":
