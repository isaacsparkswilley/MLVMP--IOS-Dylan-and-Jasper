        "Identifying Characteristics":
        [
         "Shell thin to thick; shape is highly variable: oval, trapezoidal, rectangular",
         "Two halves of the shell are typically laterally compressed (shell somewhat flattened in cross-section)",
         "Shell color is tan to brownish in juveniles and olive green, dark brown or black in adults; ray-like markings may occur on the fibrous outer lining of the shell",
         "Shell lining is iridescent purplish to rose-colored in fresh specimens, chalky white in older specimens",
         "The mantle (fleshy lining of the shell that encloses the body of the mussel) is gray, white or reddish",
         "Foot is white",
         "Size: medium-sized to large (up to 13 cm long)"

        "Biology":
        [
         "An individual can live up to 100 years",
         "Dioecious – both male and female individuals occur",
         "Males release sperm into the water which females capture in their gills",
         "Embryos develop into bivalve larvae (glochidia) in a pouch (marsupium) within the female’s gills",
         "Eastern elliptio is a ‘short-term brooder’ meaning that fertilization takes place in early spring; glochidia released later in the summer",
         "When environmental conditions are optimum, females release the glochidia into the water column where they must quickly encounter and attach to their fish host in order to survive; chances for successful attachment to a suitable host are slim",
         "Once attached to host, glochidia become encysted, and receive nutrients from the host",
         "The parasitic stage lasts from 6 to 160 days depending on species and environmental conditions, especially water temperature",
         "As glochidia mature into a juvenile mussels, they drop from the host, burrow into the sediments and begin their its bottom dwelling (benthic) existence",
         "Confirmed hosts for eastern elliptio include yellow perch and largemouth bass; other host species are assumed given the widespread distribution of this species"

        "Diet":
        [
         "Inhales water through exposed siphons, filtering out and feeding on suspended particles including plankton, organic, and inorganic material"
         
         ],
        
        "Habitat":
        [
         "Found in a wide variety of habitats: small streams, large rivers, freshwater tidal waters (such as the lower Kennebec), all types of lakes and ponds",
         "Widely adapted to a variety of substrates: clay, mud, sand, gravel, and cobble bottoms",
         "Often abundant in lake and pond habitats, and may be seen partially buried in sand, gravel, and cobble substrates in water depths up to 9 meters",
         "Less suitable habitats include unconsolidated silt bottoms such as found in deeper portions of lakes, and rocky bottoms of high-gradient mountain streams",
         "Widespread distribution suggests that this species has a wide environmental tolerance and the capacity to readily colonize new habitats"
