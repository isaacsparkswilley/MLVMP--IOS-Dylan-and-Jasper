		[	
			"Bright yellow chin and throat",     
			"Upper shell is domed but slightly flattened along the midline",   
			"Upper shell is speckled with yellow and light-colored flecks and streaks",      
			"Lower shell is yellow with symmetrical dark splotches",       
			"Head and legs are usually dark in color with yellow speckles",

		],

		"Biology":
		[	
			"Mating occurs in April and early May with nesting beginning in early June and going through the month", 
			"Take 14–20 years to reach sexual maturity",
			"Clutch size ranges from 5–12 eggs with an average of eight",
			"Reproduce through internal fertilization with copulation taking place in the water", 
			"Less than half of the adult female population will reproduce in a given year",
			"In June females travel considerable distances from water to find suitable nest sites to lay eggs", 
			"Females dig a nest cavity (approximately 17 cm deep and 7 to 10 cm in diameter at the mouth) using hind feet",  
			"Lay flexible, elliptical shaped eggs measuring about 3.6 cm long",
			"Hatchlings will emerge 50 to 75 days later (depending on the temperature and moisture in the nest) in August or early September",
			"Few young are ever encountered in the wild—hatchlings are very unlikely to survive the initial weeks away from the nest",
			"Can reproduce for approximately 40 years",     
			"Lifespan can be up to 80 years"
		],

		"Habitat":
		[	
			"Found in and around shallow weedy ponds, marshes, swamps, and lake inlets and coves",
			"Hibernate under or near water, in mud or under vegetation or debris", 
			"Prefer slow-moving, shallow water and a muddy bottom with plenty of vegetation",
			"Often found basking on logs",
			"Found wandering from water—particularly when nesting",
			"Younger turtles may bask on sedge and alder hummocks",
			"Open sunny spots in well-drained but moist sandy soil, but when lacking preferred areas, lawns, gardens, or gravel road edges will be used"
