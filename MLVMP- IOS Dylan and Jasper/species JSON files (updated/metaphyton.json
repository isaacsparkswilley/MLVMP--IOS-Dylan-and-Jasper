		"Identifying Characteristics":
		[	"Metaphyton is a term used to describe certain floating filamentous algal species that form cotton-candy-like \"clouds\" as they grow and aggregate among aquatic plants and debris in the shallow, sunlit portions of lakes and ponds",
			"Wind-induced water movements play a role in aggregating the floating algae, and forming it into cloud-like masses.",
			"Generally semi-transparent, green or greenish/yellow in color; has a filamentous or stringy texture when removed from the water",
			"Colonies vary widely in size; may be attached to aquatic plants or debris, floating, or resting on the bottom",
			"Zygnema filaments are generally free‐floating; Oedogonium can be free‐floating but also attached to substrate.",
			"Some metaphyton-forming algae will also form dense mats"
		],

		"Biology":
		[	"Tend to bloom and become most noticeable as the water in shallow areas warms during late summer",
			"Reproduction is asexual, by vegetative cell division",
			"Numerous factors affect metaphyton growth including: dissolved organic carbon, pH, sunlight, water temperature, nutrient inputs from the watershed, etc.",
			"As algae begins to decompose, clouds may float to the surface, forming large greenish bubbling masses",
			"Metaphyton clouds provide food and shelter for invertebrates, tadpoles, and small fish; Look for their tunnels!"

		"Habitat":
		[	"Lakes, ponds, wetlands",
			"Low water flow areas"

		"Commonly Seen":

			"Midwater - Shallow"
